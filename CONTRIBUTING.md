# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the project! Please follow these guidelines to ensure a clean and consistent codebase and smooth collaboration with the team.

## 📌 General Workflow

1. **Always create a new branch** for your feature or fix.
   - Use the naming convention: `feature/feature-name`, `fix/bug-name`.
2. **Pull the latest changes** from the `develop` branch before starting.
3. Submit your work via a **Pull Request**.
   - Make sure your PR has a meaningful title and clear description.
   - Link your PR to the related issue (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Add screenshots if your changes affect UI.

## 🧪 Testing

Before submitting your code:
- Run the app locally and ensure your feature works.
- Run any available test suites (if applicable).
- Make sure your code doesn't break other parts of the app.

## 🧼 Code Style

- Use our shared `.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc` configurations.
- Write clean, readable, and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code.
- Use TypeScript wherever possible and avoid using `any`.
- Follow naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components).

## 🔍 Code Reviews

- Every PR must be reviewed by at least one team member.
- Be respectful and constructive in your reviews.
- Address all comments before merging.

## ✅ Commit Message Format

Use conventional commits:

- feat: add login button
- fix: resolve navbar collapse issue
- refactor: clean up useEffect logic
- docs: update README with deployment guide
